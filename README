The [Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/) System is a standards based, open source software package for web single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries. It allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

This library determines `current_user` from environment variables set by `mod_shib` in Apache. An interface to login as any user is also provided for running in development.
